This diagram illustrates the relationships between the files in your project. Here's a breakdown of how they work together:

helloworld.c: This is the main entry point of your program. It includes:

platform.h for platform-specific functions
xil_printf.h for printing functions (not shown in your provided files)
quicksort.h for the sorting algorithm


platform.h and platform.c: These files handle platform-specific initialization and cleanup. platform.c implements the functions declared in platform.h and uses xparameters.h and xil_cache.h for low-level hardware interactions.
quicksort.h and quicksort.c: These files contain the declaration and implementation of the sorting algorithm used in your main program.
Program Execution: The main function in helloworld.c is responsible for:

UART I/O: It uses custom UART functions defined within helloworld.c to interact with the user.
Array Sorting: It uses the sorting function from quicksort.c to sort the input.



This structure allows for a clear separation of concerns:

The main logic and I/O handling are in helloworld.c
Platform-specific code is isolated in platform.c and platform.h
The sorting algorithm is separate in quicksort.c and quicksort.h

This modular approach makes the code more maintainable and allows for easier updates or replacements of specific components if needed.
